問題:太頻繁開關server導致server無法啟動
解答:Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start cloudera-scm-server.service
Job for cloudera-scm-server.service failed because start of the service was attempted too often. See "systemctl status cloudera-scm-server.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
To force a start use "systemctl reset-failed cloudera-scm-server.service" followed by "systemctl start cloudera-scm-server.service" again.
