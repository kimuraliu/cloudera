Running Your First Spark Application

Important:By default, CDH is configured to permit any user to access the Hive Metastore. However, 
if you have modified the value set for the configuration property hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups, 
which can be modified in Cloudera Manager by setting the Hive Metastore Access Control and Proxy User Groups Override property, 
your Spark application might throw exceptions when it is run. 
To address this issue, make sure you add the groups that contain 
the Spark users that you want to have access to the metastore 
when Spark applications are run to this property in Cloudera Manager:

1.In the Cloudera Manager Admin Console Home page, click the Hive service.
2.On the Hive service page, click the Configuration tab.
搜尋：(hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups)
3.In the Search well, type """""hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups""""" to locate the Hive Metastore Access Control and Proxy User Groups Override property.
新增使用者(hive2)
4.Click the plus sign (+), enter the groups you want to have access to the metastore, 
and then click Save Changes. You must restart the Hive Metastore Server for the changes to take effect by clicking the restart icon at the top of the page.
